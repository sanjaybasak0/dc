# Document classification using 1D convolution.
In this project I have done classification of the documents.Each document is consists of an email.In the dataset we have 18828 documents and there are 20 classes.Our task is to classify a document into one of the 20 classes.
Basically there are two major parts in the project.In the first part data preparation is done and in the second part building an model architecture,training the model and validation of the model are done.
# Data Preparation
In this part very complex data preprocessing is done and please go to this [file]( to check what type of data preprocessing is done.
